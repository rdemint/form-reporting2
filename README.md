I worked with a healthcare consultant to prototype this full-stack, data-entry and dashboard application built primarily with Angular 7 and the Django-rest-framework.  

Some application features/technologies include:

-JWT tokens login

-Different landing pages based on user-type

-Angular Material Forms for data-entry that post to the backend

-ChartJs / ngchart2 for dashboard of data entered by all users of the organization, or client.  Filtered & responsive charts by data type

-Rxjs (i.e. Behaviorsubjects) to manage asynchronous API calls

-Bootstrap & Angular Material components for a solid, appealing UI

-CSS for the UI
